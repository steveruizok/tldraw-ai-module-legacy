# tldraw ai module

This repo shows how the AI module's source code could be brought into a different project. The AI module was a small API for defining how a prompt could be built and sent to a backend, where the prompt could be used to generate instructions. These instructions would then be used to create, update, or delete content in the tldraw editor.

We pulled out the ai module and improved the API for the AI starter kit, however even the AI starter is likely more than you'd need to get a minimal working AI integration in tldraw.

If you'd started working with the AI module and want to bring the code into your project, copy the src/ai folder into your project.
